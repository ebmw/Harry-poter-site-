# üè• Pharma ‚Äî Parapharmacies Online Platform

## üìú Project Description
This project is an **online platform** that connects parapharmacies and customers, offering a streamlined solution for browsing and purchasing healthcare and beauty products. It simplifies the process for both parties by enabling efficient online orders and providing parapharmacies with tools to manage stock and customer interactions. This service addresses the lack of digital infrastructure in Algeria, where most parapharmacies are not organized for efficient order handling, often leading to delays.
